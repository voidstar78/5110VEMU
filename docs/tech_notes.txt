"Each of these levels has 16 two-byte registers.  These registers are addressable as the lowest 128 bytes of read/write storage and are located on the processor card.  Register 0 of each level acts as an instruction address register.... The remaining 15 registers in each program level can be used as general purpose registers."

"Executable ROS is divided into ROS 1 and ROS 2.  During the power up sequence, the powr on reset (POR) activates ROS 1 mode, and the processor begins executing instructions from executable ROS.  The processor begins executing the bring up diagnostic at the address contained at location 000A, ending with the IPL routine."

STOP BASIC = press ATTN
RESUME BASIC = use "GO" command
BACKSPACE = CMD + LEFT ARROW         (more like pressing DELETE)

HOLD
CMD -    (keypad minus)  --> DCP mode
CMD */X  (on keypad)     --> DIAG DCP mode
CMD +    (keypad plus)   --> EXIT DCP mode (back to BASIC/APL console)

"Oscillators/Clocks: The processor uses a 15.1 MHz oscillator to generate 66.2 nanosecond clock pulses. These multiclock cycle (MCC) pulses are used to control data throughout the computing system.  MCC pulses make up the I phase (instruction) and E phase (execute) machine cycles."

"Each I-phase consists of three I cycles.  I cycles 1 and 3 consist of 3 MCC pulses.  I-cycle 2 consists of 8 MCC pulses."
"Each E-phase consists of one through five E cycles.  E cycles can be either 3 MCC or 8 MCC pulses, depending on the instruction being executed."
"I cycle 1 - The contents of program level register 0 are loaded into SAR."
"I cycle 2 - SAR addresses either R/W storge or executable ROS and transfers the microinstruction located at that address into the operation register."
"I cycle 3 - The address in the SAR is incremented by two and read back into register 0 of the current program level."
"E phase - .... Only R/W storage can be addressed during execute cycles."
